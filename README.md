Mozilla for OS/2
================

This repository contains the source code for the Mozilla project
with the patches for the OS/2 operating system (more known now as
eComStation).

The repository contains the mozilla component used to build the
Firefox product. The build system is changed from autoconf to kBuild
in order to simplify maintenance and speed up the build process.
