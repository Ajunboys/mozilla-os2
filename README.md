Mozilla for OS/2
================

This repository contains the source code for the Mozilla project
with the patches for the OS/2 operating system (more known now as
eComStation).

The repository contains all parts of the Mozilla code base needed
to build the two major Mozilla products, Firefox and Thunderbird,
on OS/2. The build system is changed from autoconf to kBuild in
order to dramatically simplify and speed up the build process.
